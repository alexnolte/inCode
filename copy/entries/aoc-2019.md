Keeping up with the [advent of code][aoc] tradition on this blog, I'm just
letting anyone interested know that I am participating again this year!  I
still have my [daily reflections][reflections] as well, if you are interested
in following along with what I hope are clean Haskell solutions for each part.
I'll also be posting short blog posts when I can if I find anything especially
interesting :)

This year I also have an [rss feed][rss] for my reflections as well, if you
want to follow it like a blog.

If you are playing along as well, it's not late to join the semi-official
[Haskell Leaderboard][lb] (join code `43100-84040706`) --- we'd love to have
you along!  We also have a lot of fun discussions in [freenode][] channel
`##adventofcode`, and also in the [FP slack][slack].

And if you're using Haskell, you might be able to make your life easier by
using my [Advent of Code API Bindings][aoc-api], for fetching inputs and
prompts and making submissions.

Best wishes to all of you this advent season!
