\title{Fictions about Fictitious Forces}
\author{Justin Le}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\emph{Originally posted on
\textbf{\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/fictitious-forces.html}{in Code}}.}

The other day I ran into \href{https://i.imgur.com/tkCsLYM.gifv}{this video} of
a pilot of a jet plane apparently pouring water from a bottle into a cup while
in the middle of a roll. The interesting effect is that the water continues to
flow into the cup, apparently defying gravity, throughout the entirety of the
roll. The camera follows the plane's rotation, so it looks like the water is
being poured normally the entire time, even though the ground is seen rotating
around the plane in the background.

In the ensuing discussion, someone commented that this was a good example
demonstrating centrifugal force. Someone then replied ``Actually, it's the
centripetal force.''

I replied, and in the process of explaining why centripetal force \emph{doesn't}
explain what is happening here, I came to realize a few key misconceptions that
people have when thinking about ``fictitious'' (or pseudo-, or inertial) forces.

Do you subscribe to this view?

\begin{quote}
The centrifugal force is not a ``real force'', because it's just ``the
centripetal force'' in disguise. Every usage of the centrifugal force can be
re-interpreted as ``the centripetal force'', and vice versa. It's just two ways
of looking at the same thing.
\end{quote}

This sort of view trains you into thinking that, if you see a ``centrifugal
force'', you should find the ``real force'' that is responsible for it. And that
``real force'' is ``the centripetal force''. That's what's \emph{really}
happening\ldots{} right?

This fallacy is exactly what struck Commenter B. Commenter B saw something that
could be interpreted as a centrifugal force. Their logic then proceeded thusly:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ah, everyone knows that the centrifugal force isn't a ``real force''. I have
  to correct it.
\item
  Well, what's the \emph{real} force behind the water falling into the cup?
\item
  Isn't the centrifugal force just ``the centripetal force'', but in a different
  viewpoint?
\item
  So, it must be ``the centripetal force''!
\end{itemize}

Of course, if you do hold the viewpoint above, this all feels justified. And you
feel satisfied that you were able to
\href{https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11730}{give a name to the
phenomenon}. That is, until you think about it a little deeper.

Remember, the original question is ``When the water is in the air, what is
causing it to move towards the cup?''

If your answer is ``the centripetal force'', then you have some
problems\ldots{}because you then have to explain where the force is coming from.
It's not gravity, and it's not the spinning motion of the plane (that's going
``sideways'', the opposite direction of a centripetal force). So, what is it?
What force is acting on the water?

And that's where you start to see that, no matter what your views on the
metaphysical reality of fictitious forces are, ``centripetal force'' is
certainly \emph{not} the explanation.

So\ldots{}what is?
