\title{Setting up a dead-simple TCP/IP service using servant}

\emph{Originally posted on
\textbf{\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/servant-services.html}{in Code}}.}

In my time I've written a lot of throwaway binary TCP/IP services (servers and
services you can interact with over an internet connection, through command line
interface or GUI). For me, this involves designing a protocol from scratch every
time with varying levels of hand-rolled authentication and error detection (Send
this byte for this command, this byte for this other command, etc.). Once I
design the protocol, I then have to write both the client and the server ---
something I usually do from scratch over the raw TCP streams.

This process was fun (and informative) the first few times I did it, but
spinning it up from scratch again every time discouraged me from doing it very
often. However, thankfully, with the
\emph{\href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant}{servant}} haskell
library, writing a TCP server/client pair for a TCP service becomes dead-simple
--- the barrier for creating one fades away that designing/writing a service
becomes a tool that I reach for immediately in a lot of cases without second
thought.

\emph{servant} is usually advertised as a tool for writing web servers and web
applications, but it's easily adapted to write non-web things as well
(especially with the help of
\emph{\href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-cli}{servant-cli}}).
Let's dive in and write a simple TCP/IP service (a todo list manager) to see how
straightforward the process is!
