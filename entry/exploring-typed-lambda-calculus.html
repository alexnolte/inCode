<p>Keep in mind that the struggles contained in this post are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not representative of most day-to-day practical type-level Haskell, a la <em>servant</em> and other type-level user-friendly libraries.</li>
<li>More likely than not to be very trivial in a language with actual dependent types, like Idris.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-motivation">The motivation</h2>
<p>Here I summarize the motivation behind this project. Feel free to skip!</p>
<p>One of my favorite Haskell projects in the past year or so has been <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">dhall</a>, a typed and functional turing-incomplete strongly normalizing configuration language. I honestly believe that dhall is the solution to many of the problems of configuration languages (w.r.t json, yaml, xml) in modern software development, and I hope to see it gain widespread adoption some day as a “killer app” of functional turing-incomplete programming.</p>
<p>One day I came across a post on the Haskell subreddit asking if there was a nice way to allow user scripts within a Haskell application, and I suggested maybe to allow users to provide scripts as dhall programs that are interpreted by Haskell applications. This idea interested me; I tried out a proof-of-concept with monoidal actions, and it wasn’t too bad. But to allow for more expressive scripts, I tried implementing a framework with <em>monadic</em> actions. I tried implementing a general framework using church-encoded free monads, and (aside from the lack of type inference) it wasn’t altogether too awful.</p>
<p>However, writing the Haskell code to <em>import</em> these monadic actions into Haskell wasn’t very fun. The only way I knew how was basically to interpret an untyped Dhall AST (parsed into Haskell) into something you could run within Haskell.</p>
<p>Interpreting an untyped Dhall AST within Haskell is as much fun as you’d think it would be (that is, not very). It’s essentially the same thing as writing a <code>FromJSON</code> instance — something you want to avoid doing by hand whenever possible.</p>
<p>This is where I got the idea: instead of interpreting an untyped Dhall AST…why don’t we interpret a <em>typed</em> Dhall AST? That is, an AST where the <em>type</em> of the Dhall expression is directly a part of the type of the AST value. In my mind, a <code>DTerm a</code> would be a dhall term that represents something of type <code>a</code>. From there, you can then convert any typed Dhall AST term into a Haskell value representing a type you can know statically.</p>
<p>Instead of parsing a <code>Expr</code> into your ADT in a way that might fail (because of a bad <code>Expr</code>), you can parse an <em>explicitly typed</em> <code>Expr</code> into your ADT, in a way that you ensure all of the fields exist, etc., in a <em>total</em> way.</p>
<p>And, in the context of dhall scripting, you could actually just explicitly “run” the typed ADT directly within Haskell to produce something of an expected type (like a free monad instantiation).</p>
<p>So, that was the dream. How hard could it be?</p>
<h2 id="dhall-calculus">Dhall Calculus</h2>
<p>The first step in my journey was to understand the formal system that Dhall is based on. According to the documentation, dhall has roots in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_F#System_F.CF.89">System Fω</a>.</p>
<p>After doing some heavy digging and reading, this is what I gathered:</p>
<h3 id="the-hierarchy">The Hierarchy</h3>
<p>We have a hierarchy of values and their meta-level “types”. At the bottom, we have terms (<code>1</code>, <code>True</code>, <code>"hello"</code>, etc.). You can write functions, applications, etc. with terms. To help us reason with terms, all terms are categorized into <em>types</em> (<code>Bool</code>, <code>Natural</code>, etc.).</p>
<p>However, types are also their own level of values, in that we can have type-level functions and things like that. In order to allow us to reason with these type-level constructs, we categories types into <em>kinds</em> (<code>Type</code>, <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>), and say that the kind of types that can categorize values is <code>Type</code>.</p>
<p>In Dhall, kinds are also their own level of values. We can have kind-level functions and function application, and all of those complex structures. To help us reason with kinds, we categorize kinds into <em>sorts</em> (<code>Kind</code>, <code>Kind -&gt; Kind</code>, etc.), and say that the sort of kinds that can categorize types is <code>Kind</code>.</p>
<p>In Dhall, the level of sorts is where things essentially end. While Dhall sorts are also their own level of values in a sense, there is a limitation: we cannot make <em>sort functions</em>, and we cannot have <em>sort variables</em>. They are (perhaps superficially) forbidden in Dhall. This effectively stops the hierarchy, because there is no need to consider the meta-level “type” of a sort. By forbidding sort variables and sort functions and similar abstractions, we basically make “order” (the “type” of a sort) a meaningless construct. We make <code>Sort</code> the “order” of sorts that can categorize kinds, but this fundamental limitation means that <code>Sort</code> is the only order that exists.</p>
<h3 id="within-a-level">Within a Level</h3>
<p>Alright, so we’ve established <em>why</em> the hierarchy exists, what gives rise to them, and the mechanism that essentially cuts it off at <em>sort</em>.</p>
<p>So, what actually <em>lives</em> at each of these levels? What sort of structures do we allow that exist completely <em>within</em> a level (discounting things that span multiple levels)?</p>
<h4 id="primitives">Primitives</h4>
<p>At each level exists the primitives of that level that are provided by the language. Think of these as the “built-in terms”, “built-in types”, “built-in kinds”, etc. Without primitives, we’d just be manipulating lambdas all day (which is, incidentally, what <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/morte">morte</a> is. In a way, Dhall can be thought of as just a fork of morte that adds primitives).</p>
<p>At the <em>term</em> level, we have primitives like:</p>
<pre class="dhall"><code>1
&quot;hello&quot;
-8
List/fold
Natural/even</code></pre>
<p>And also more complex primitive “constructors”, that combine sub-terms</p>
<pre class="dhall"><code>x + y                       -- operators in Dhall
[x,y,z]                     -- list literals in Dhall
{ foo = x, bar = y }        -- record literals in Dhall
x ∧ y                       -- record merging in Dhall
&lt; Left = x | Right : y &gt;    -- union literals in Dhall; x is a term, y is a type</code></pre>
<p>At the <em>type</em> level, we have primitives like:</p>
<pre class="dhall"><code>Bool
Text
List</code></pre>
<p>And primitive “constructors:”</p>
<pre class="dhall"><code>{ foo : x, bar : y }       -- record types in Dhall; x and y are types of kind Type
x ⩓ y                      -- merging record types in Dhall
{ foo = x, bar = y }       -- type-level record literals in Dhall; x and y are types
&lt; Left : x | Right : y &gt;   -- union types in Dhall; x and y are types of kind Type
&lt; Left = x | Right : y &gt;   -- type-level union literals in Dhall; x is a type, y is a kind</code></pre>
<p>At the <em>kind</em> level, we only have the kinds of type-level records and unions and also kind-level records and unions (and the operations on them) as primitives. At the <em>sort</em> level, we only have the sorts of kind-level records and unions, and also sort-level records and unions (and operations on them).</p>
<h4 id="function-abstraction">Function abstraction</h4>
<p>At all levels (except for <em>sort</em>), we have the <em>function abstraction</em>, that looks like:</p>
<pre class="dhall"><code>\(x : blah) -&gt; thing</code></pre>
<p>Here are examples at the term, type, and kind levels:</p>
<pre class="dhall"><code>-- Term-level
\(x : Natural) -&gt; x + 2
-- Type-level
\(x : Type) -&gt; List x
-- Kind-level
\(x : Kind -&gt; Kind) -&gt; x Type</code></pre>
<p>Disallowing sort-level function abstractions is a mechanism of artificially “cutting off” the effective hierarchy at sort. In theory, we could go on forever; but what ever level we disallow lambdas at is the level that our hierarchy stops at.</p>
<p>An important point here is that these are all lambdas “within” a single level. The <em>input</em> and the <em>output</em> are all within the same level: term to term, type to type, kind to kind, etc.</p>
<p>As a consequence of “having function abstractions”, we also gain a couple of other constructs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Variables</strong>: At all levels with function abstractions, we can talk about <em>variables</em> at that level. A variable is <em>bound</em> if it’s inside the body of a lambda that introduces it, and is <em>free</em> otherwise.</li>
<li><p><strong>Function Application</strong>: At all levels with function abstractions, we also have <em>function applications</em>, which is the application of a function abstraction to a value:</p>
<pre class="dhall"><code>-- Term level
(\(x : Natural) -&gt; x + 2) 4
-- Type level
(\(x : Type) -&gt; List x) Bool</code></pre>
<p><em>Technically</em>, we can actually have function application on levels without function applications, of that level has the apropriate primitives (like <code>List</code> on the type level, <code>Natural/show</code> at the value level). However, in Dhall, this doesn’t happen, so we’re going to address this as essentially paired with function abstraction.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="type-levels">Type levels</h4>
<p>If a level is a “type” of another (type, kind, sort), they also have a <em>function type</em> construct, which is the <em>type</em> of lambda abstractions on the level below.</p>
<p>For example, a term-level lambda abstraction of type <code>\(x : Natural) -&gt; x + 2</code> has the type <code>Natural -&gt; Natural</code>, which lives on the type level. Again, this is specifically for functions on the “same level”.</p>
<p>This construct might also classify primitives on the level above. For example, the <code>Natural/isEven</code> primitive in Dhall has type <code>Natural -&gt; Bool</code>.</p>
<h4 id="type-of-type-levels">Type-of-type levels</h4>
<p>If a level is the “type” of a level that is a “type” of another type, it must also have a “constant” to tie the levels below together. That is, there is a kind <code>Type</code>, that is the kind of all types that categorize terms. We also have the sort <code>Kind</code>, that is the sort of all kinds that categorize types.</p>
<h4 id="recap">Recap</h4>
<p>That’s a lot of constructs, and a lot of conditions. So just to recap, here’s a list of all constructors on each of the levels that we have gone over so far:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Term</dt>
<dd>Primitives
</dd>
<dd>Function abstraction
</dd>
<dd>Function application
</dd>
<dt>Type</dt>
<dd>Primitives
</dd>
<dd>Function abstraction
</dd>
<dd>Function application
</dd>
<dd>Function type
</dd>
<dt>Kind</dt>
<dd>Primitives
</dd>
<dd>Function abstraction
</dd>
<dd>Function application
</dd>
<dd>Function type
</dd>
<dd>Constant (<code>Type</code>)
</dd>
<dt>Sort</dt>
<dd>Primitives
</dd>
<dd>Function type
</dd>
<dd>Constant (<code>Kind</code>)
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All of these constructs are things that are “within the same level”.</p>
<h3 id="inter-level">Inter-Level</h3>
<p>Finally, we have three inter-level constructs: <em>type abstraction</em>, <em>type application</em>, and <em>type abstraction type</em>. I like to call them <em>polymorphism</em>, <em>instantiation</em>, and <em>forall</em>, as they are realized in Haskell.</p>
<p><strong>Type abstraction</strong> (polymorphism) lets us parameterize a value based on something of a type above. A common example is the identity function in Haskell, which has type <code>forall a. a -&gt; a</code>. In Haskell, type abstractions are always implicit; we don’t ever explicitly write them out, and instead the Haskell compiler implicitly creates it for us with no syntactic overhead. In Dhall, type abstractions are always explicit: the polymorphic identity function is written as <code>\(a : Type) -&gt; \(x : a) -&gt; x</code>.</p>
<p>In Dhall, there are three type abstractions allowed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Terms parameterized on types (polymorphic terms)</li>
<li>Terms parameterized on kinds (kind-polymorphic terms)</li>
<li>Types parameterized on kinds (kind-polymorphic types)</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe this is a fundamental limit of disallowing sort variables. If we allowed sort-variables, then we’d also have terms parameterized on sorts, types parameterized on sorts, and kinds parameterized on sorts, adding three new type abstractions.</p>
<p><strong>Type application</strong> (instantiation) lets us <em>apply</em> a type abstraction to some input of the appropriate level, or to “instantiate a type variable”, in Haskell-speak.</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>type abstraction type</strong> is the meta-level “type* of a type abstraction, just like how a function type is the”type" of a function abstraction. Again, there are three in Dhall:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The type of terms parameterized on types</li>
<li>The type of terms parameterized on kinds</li>
<li>The kind of types parameterized on kinds</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that although these are the types of type abstractions, <em>primitives</em> can also have these types. For example, the <code>None</code> term primitive in Dhall has type <code>forall (a : Type). Optional a</code>. Its type is #1 on the list above: <code>None</code> is a term parameterized on a type, and its type is the type of terms parameterized on types.</p>
<h3 id="final-summary">Final Summary</h3>
<p>To summarize, here’s all of the constructs in Dhall:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Term</dt>
<dd>Primitives
</dd>
<dd>Function abstraction
</dd>
<dd>Function application
</dd>
<dd>Type abstraction (parameterized on types)
</dd>
<dd>Type application (parameterized on types)
</dd>
<dd>Type abstraction (parameterized on kinds)
</dd>
<dd>Type application (parameterized on kinds)
</dd>
<dt>Type</dt>
<dd>Primitives
</dd>
<dd>Function abstraction
</dd>
<dd>Function application
</dd>
<dd>Type abstraction (parameterized on kinds)
</dd>
<dd>Type application (parameterized on kinds)
</dd>
<dd>Function type
</dd>
<dd>Type abstraction type (terms parameterized on types)
</dd>
<dd>Type abstraction type (terms parameterized on kinds)
</dd>
<dt>Kind</dt>
<dd>Primitives
</dd>
<dd>Function abstraction
</dd>
<dd>Function application
</dd>
<dd>Function type
</dd>
<dd>Type abstraction type (types parameterized on kinds)
</dd>
<dd>Constant (<code>Type</code>)
</dd>
<dt>Sort</dt>
<dd>Primitives
</dd>
<dd>Function type
</dd>
<dd>Constant (<code>Kind</code>)
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that Dhall also has <code>let .. in ..</code> constructs, for mostly quality of life purposes. They don’t really affect the semantics, but we can essentially treat them like function abstractions or type applications that are immediately applied. So, <code>let x = Natural in blah</code> is <code>(\(x : Type) -&gt; blah) Natural</code>. However, this does restrict us to only have <code>let .. in ..</code>s that correspond to an appropriate function or type abstraction — so we can’t, say, do <code>let x = 1 in Kind</code>, since there is no abstraction that takes a term and returns a sort.</p>
<h3 id="normalization-and-typing-rules">Normalization and Typing Rules</h3>
<p>Of course, listing these constructs is one story. Getting the type of them (and the type of their components) is a different one. For example, we know that applying a function of type <code>Natural -&gt; Bool</code> to a term of type <code>Natural</code> gives us a term of type <code>Bool</code>. However, we’ll gloss over this for now as we continue on this high-level overview.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-dhall-do-it">How does Dhall do it?</h3>
<p>In the typical Haskell way, the system is implemented as an ADT, where each construct is (surprise) a constructor.</p>
<p>However, the untyped Dhall AST squishes all of the distinction between all of the levels. Half of my journey was actually in re-separating each of these levels!</p>
<p>The untyped Dhall AST has the following constructors:</p>
<ul>
<li>A constructor for each primitive (on all levels)</li>
<li>A constructor for each constant</li>
<li>A single constructor for all function abstractions <em>and</em> type abstractions (that is, a single constructor for all levels).</li>
<li>A single constructor for all function applications <em>and</em> type applications (again, one constructor for all levels).</li>
<li>A single constructor for all function types <em>and</em> type application (of all levels).</li>
</ul>
<p>(And also the <code>let .. in ..</code> constructor)</p>
<p>So at this point, the plan seems clear: simply distinguish each of the “squished” abstractions into the four different levels (“unsquish” them), and make them a GADT parameterized on on the types with the right inductive rules.</p></div><footer><hr><div class="copy-content"><p>Hi, thanks for reading!
